The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;$URL_PATTERN&quot;, &quot;filter&quot; : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the &quot;ISSUER&quot; and the &quot;SUBJECT&quot; sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with the &quot;O&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with a &quot;OU&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

Leaving the policy unset means there's no autoselection for any site.

Devices will not be able to check for updates automatically during the specified time intervals. Devices that require an enterprise rollback or are below the minimum Google Chrome OS version will not be affected by this policy due to potential security issues. Furthermore, this policy will not block update checks requested by users or administrators.
Starting from M88, this policy cancels an ongoing update when a restricted time interval is reached. The next auto update after the restricted time interval ends will automatically resume the update. Devices updating to a Quick Fix Build will not be affected by this policy.
When this policy is unset or contains no time intervals:
No automatic update checks will be blocked by this policy, but they may be blocked by other policies.
Till M88, this feature is only enabled on Google Chrome OS devices configured as auto-launch kiosks. Other devices will not be restricted by this policy. However starting from M89, this policy is enabled on all Google Chrome OS devices.

When this policy is set to a non-empty list:
If none of the entries has a chromeos_version greater than the current version of the device, then no restrictions are applied and the already existing restrictions are revoked.
If at least one of the entries has a chromeos_version greater than the current version, the entry whose version is greater and closest to the current version is chosen.
In case of conflict, preference is given to the entry with lower warning_period or aue_warning_period and the policy is applied using that entry.

If the current version becomes obsolete during user session and the current network limits auto updates, an on-screen notification is shown to update the device within the warning_period shown in the notification.
No notifications are shown if the current network allows auto updates and the device must be updated within the warning_period.
The warning_period starts from the time the policy is applied.
If the device is not updated till the expiry of the warning_period, the user is signed out of the session.
If the current version is found to be obsolete at the time of login with expired warning_period, the user is required to update the device before signing in.

If the current version becomes obsolete during user session and the device has reached auto update expiration, an on-screen notification is shown to return the device within aue_warning_period.
If the device is found to have reached auto update expiration at the time of login with expired aue_warning_period, the device is blocked for any user to sign in.

Unmanaged user sessions do not receive notifications and force log out if unmanaged_user_restricted is unset or set to False.

If this policy is not set or set to empty, no restrictions are applied, already existing restrictions are revoked and user can sign in regardless of Google Chrome OS version.

Here chromeos_version can be either an exact version like '13305.0.0' or a version prefix, like '13305'.
The warning_period and aue_warning_period are optional values specified in number of days. Default value for them is 0 days, which means that there is no warning period.
The unmanaged_user_restricted is an optional property with default value as False.

If the warning time mentioned in DeviceMinimumVersion policy has not expired, this message is shown on the Chrome management page after user sign in.

If this policy is not set or set to empty, the default auto update expiration message is shown to the user in both of the above cases.
The auto update expiration message must be plain text without any formatting. No markup is allowed.

Example value: This device has reached auto update expiration.

If policy value is set to a token that maps to a Quick Fix Build, the device will be updated to the corresponding Quick Fix Build if the update is not blocked by another policy.

If this policy is not set, or if its value does not map to a Quick Fix Build, then the device won't be updated to a Quick Fix Build. If the device is already running a Quick Fix Build and the policy is not set anymore or its value does not map to a Quick Fix Build anymore, then the device will be updated to a regular build if the update is not blocked by another policy.

Default is 0 for consumer, 4 (approx. half a year) for enterprise enrolled devices.

Setting this policy prevents rollback protection to apply for at least this number of milestones.

Setting this policy to a lower value has a permanent effect: the device MAY not be able to roll back to earlier versions even after the policy is reset to a larger value.

Specifies the prefix of a target version Google Chrome OS should update to. If the device is running a version that's before the specified prefix, it will update to the latest version with the given prefix. If the device is already on a later version, effects depend on the value of DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion. The prefix format works component-wise as is demonstrated in the following example:

&quot;&quot; (or not configured): update to latest version available.
&quot;1412.&quot;: update to any minor version of 1412 (e.g. 1412.24.34 or 1412.60.2)
&quot;1412.2.&quot;: update to any minor version of 1412.2 (e.g. 1412.2.34 or 1412.2.2)
&quot;1412.24.34&quot;: update to this specific version only

Warning: It is not recommended to configure version restrictions as they may prevent users from receiving software updates and critical security fixes. Restricting updates to a specific version prefix might leave users at risk.

Example value: 1412.</string><string id="DeviceTargetVersionSelector">Allow devices to select a specific version to update to</string><string id="DeviceTargetVersionSelector_Explain">This setting allows devices to select a specific target version of Google Chrome OS they will update to.

If not set, devices will update according to other settings or to the latest available version.

If set, devices will update up to a selected version.

The exact format of this policy value is an implementation detail of the update service and may change. The policy value is not processed on the device.

If used together with DeviceTargetVersionPrefix, this policy will be checked first by update service.
Unlike DeviceTargetVersionPrefix (which may allow minor updates), devices will stay on the selected version until the value of this policy is changed.

If used together with DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion, device version can be reverted to a specific previous version.

The device may wait a portion of this time in terms of wall-clock-time and the remaining portion in terms of the number of update checks. In any case, the scatter is upper bounded to a constant amount of time so that a device does not ever get stuck waiting to download an update forever.</string><string id="DeviceUpdateStagingSchedule">The staging schedule for applying a new update</string><string id="DeviceUpdateStagingSchedule_Explain">This policy defines a list of percentages that will define the fraction of Google Chrome OS devices in the OU to update per day starting from the day the update is first discovered. The discovery time is later than the update published time, since it could be a while after the update publishing until the device checks for updates.

Each (day, percentage) pair contains which percentage of the fleet has to be updated by the given number of days since the update has been discovered. For example, if we have the pairs [(4, 40), (10, 70), (15, 100)], then 40% of the fleet should have been updated 4 days after seeing the update. 70% should be updated after 10 days, and so on.

If there is a value defined for this policy, updates will ignore the DeviceUpdateScatterFactor policy and follow this policy instead.

If this list is empty, there will be no staging and updates will be applied according to other device policies.

When this policy is set to false, no automatic reboot is scheduled after applying a Google Chrome OS update. The update process is completed when the user next reboots the device.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

Note: Currently, automatic reboots are only enabled while the login screen is being shown or a kiosk app session is in progress.</string><string id="Display_group">Display</string><string id="DeviceDisplayResolution">Set display resolution and scale factor</string><string id="DeviceDisplayResolution_Explain">Setting the policy sets the resolution and scale factor for each display. External display settings apply to connected displays. (The policy doesn't apply if a display doesn't support the specified resolution or scale.)

Setting external_use_native to True means the policy ignores external_width and external_height and sets external displays to their native resolution. Setting external_use_native to False or leaving it and external_width or external_height unset means the policy doesn't affect external displays.

Setting the recommended flag to True lets users change resolution and scale factor of any display through the settings page, but their settings change back at the next reboot. Setting the recommended flag to False or leaving it unset means users can't change the display settings.

Note: Set external_width and external_height in pixels and external_scale_percentage and internal_scale_percentage in percents.

If the policy is set to Default (0) or not set, v2 extensions loading are decided by device, following the timeline above.
If the policy is set to Disable (1), v2 extensions installation are blocked, existing ones are disabled. The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set after v2 support is turned off by default.
If the policy is set to Enable (2), v2 extensions are allowed. The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set before v2 support is turned off by default.
If the policy is set to EnableForForcedExtensions (3), force installed v2 extensions are allowed. This includes extensions that are listed by ExtensionInstallForcelist or ExtensionSettings with installation_mode &quot;force_installed&quot; or &quot;normal_installed&quot;. All other v2 extensions are disabled. The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set before v2 support is turned off by default.

Leaving the policy unset results in no restrictions on the acceptable extension and app types.

Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

* &quot;extension&quot;

* &quot;theme&quot;

* &quot;user_script&quot;

* &quot;hosted_app&quot;

* &quot;legacy_packaged_app&quot;

* &quot;platform_app&quot;

See the Google Chrome extensions documentation for more information on these types.

Versions earlier than 75 that use multiple comma separated extension IDs aren't supported and are skipped. The rest of the policy applies.

Note: This policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed using ExtensionInstallForcelist.

Example value:

hosted_app</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypesDesc">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlist">Configure extension installation allow list</string><string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which extensions are not subject to the blocklist.

A blocklist value of * means all extensions are blocked and users can only install extensions listed in the allow list.

By default, all extensions are allowed. But, if you prohibited extensions by policy, use the list of allowed extensions to change that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlistDesc">Configure extension installation allow list</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklist">Configure extension installation blocklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklist_Explain">Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blocklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Google Chrome.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklistDesc">Configure extension installation blocklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off. Permissions are granted implicitly, including for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. (These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.)

Leaving the policy unset means no apps or extensions are autoinstalled, and users can uninstall any app or extension in Google Chrome.

This policy supersedes ExtensionInstallBlocklist policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Google Chrome automatically uninstalls it.

On Microsoft® Windows® instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

The source code of any extension may be altered by users through developer tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on chrome://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the &quot;update&quot; URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate ). By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used. The &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest.

 Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito mode. Read about hosting extensions ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting ).

Example value:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx
abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelistDesc">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which URLs may install extensions, apps, and themes. Before Google Chrome 21, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Google Chrome would offer to install the file after a few warnings. Afterwards, such files must be downloaded and dragged to the Google Chrome settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

ExtensionInstallBlocklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blocklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

The policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID &quot;*&quot;, which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest ( http://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Configure_ExtensionSettings_policy ). If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the &quot;update&quot; URL specified in the ExtensionInstallForcelist policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is a Chrome Web Store url.

Note: For Microsoft® Windows® instances not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain and macOS instances not managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

That CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName has an organizationName attribute.

* It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate has the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

If the setting is changed while the user is signed into a multiprofile session, all users in the session will be checked against their corresponding settings. The session will be closed if any one of the users is no longer allowed to be in the session.

If the policy is left not set, the default value 'MultiProfileUserBehaviorMustBePrimary' applies for enterprise-managed users and 'MultiProfileUserBehaviorUnrestricted' will be used for non-managed users.

This policy does not take precedence over AllowDeletingBrowserHistory.

This policy requires the SyncDisabled policy to be set to true, otherwise it will be ignored. If this policy is set at platform level, Sync should be disabled at platform level. If this policy is set at user level, Sync should be disabled for that user in order for this policy to take effect.

Examples of such components include the certificate revocation lists and subresource filters.</string><string id="CORSNonWildcardRequestHeadersSupport">CORS non-wildcard request headers support</string><string id="CORSNonWildcardRequestHeadersSupport_Explain">Configures support of CORS non-wildcard request headers.

Google Chrome version 97 introduces support for CORS non-wildcard request headers. When scripts make a cross-origin network request via fetch() and XMLHttpRequest with a script-added Authorization header, the header must be explicitly allowed by the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response. &quot;Explicitly&quot; here means that the wild card symbol &quot;*&quot; doesn't cover the Authorization header. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5742041264816128 for more detail.

If this policy is not set, or set to True, Google Chrome will support the CORS non-wildcard request headers and behave as described above.

When this policy is set to False, chrome will allow the wildcard symbol (&quot;*&quot;) in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response to cover the Authorization header.

Setting this policy to True will switch on real-time reporting of data leak prevention events.
Setting this policy to False or leaving it unset will switch off the reporting.
Rules defined with ALLOW level restrictions in DataLeakPreventionRulesList will not report events in both cases.</string><string id="DataLeakPreventionRulesList">Sets a list of data leak prevention rules.</string><string id="DataLeakPreventionRulesList_Explain">Configures a list of rules to prevent data leak on Google Chrome OS.
Data leak can happen by copying and pasting data, transferring files, printing, screensharing, or taking screenshots ...etc.

Each rule consists of the following:
- A list of sources defined as URLs. Any data in the sources will be considered confidential data, to which the restrictions will be applied.
- A list of destinations defined as URLs or components, to which the confidential data is either allowed or disallowed to be shared.
- A list of restrictions to be applied on the data of the sources.

Rules can be added to:
- Control the clipboard data shared between the sources and the destinations.
- Control taking screenshots of any of the sources.
- Control printing of any of the sources.
- Control the privacy screen when any of the sources is visible.
- Control screen sharing of any of the sources.
- Control files downloaded from any of the sources when they are transferred to the destination. Supported on Google Chrome OS version 108 and higher.

The restriction level can be set to BLOCK, ALLOW, REPORT, WARN.
- If the restriction level is set to BLOCK, the action won't be allowed. If DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled is set to True, the blocked action will be reported to the admin.
- If the restriction level is set to ALLOW, the action will be allowed.
- If the restriction level is set to REPORT and DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled is set to True, the action will be reported to the admin.
- If the restriction level is set to WARN, a user will be warned and may choose to proceed with or cancel the action. If DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled is set to True, showing the warning will be reported to the admin; proceeding with the action will also be reported.

Notes:
- PRIVACY_SCREEN restriction doesn't block the ability to turn on privacy screen, but enforces it when the restriction class is set to BLOCK.
- Destinations cannot be empty in case one of the restrictions is CLIPBOARD or FILES, but they don't make any difference for the remaining restrictions.
- DRIVE and USB destinations are ignored for CLIPBOARD restriction.
- Format the URL patterns according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ).

If the policy is left not set, no restrictions will be applied.

Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid.

The USB permission model will grant the specified URL permission to access the USB device as a top-level origin. If embedded frames need to access USB devices, the 'usb' feature-policy header should be used to grant access. The URL must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

Deprecated: The USB permission model used to support specifying both the requesting and embedding URLs. This is deprecated and only supported for backwards compatiblity in this manner: if both a requesting and embedding URL is specified, then the embedding URL will be granted the permission as top-level origin and the requsting URL will be ignored entirely.

Once set to True, the device will reboot to the schedule. The policy must be removed to cancel any more scheduled reboots.

In user sessions and guest sessions, the following applies:

  * The users are notified that the restart will occur 1 hour before the scheduled time. They have an option to restart then or wait for the scheduled reboot. The scheduled reboot cannot be deferred.

  * There is a 1 hour grace period after the device is booted. Scheduled reboots are skipped during this period and rescheduled for the next day, week, or month, depending on the setting.

In kiosk sessions, there is no grace period and no notifications about the reboot.

The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

This detection may not be necessary in an enterprise environment where the network configuration is known, since it causes some amount of DNS and HTTP traffic on start-up and each DNS configuration change.

When this policy is not set, or is enabled, the DNS interception checks are performed. When explicitly disabled, they're not.</string><string id="DnsOverHttpsMode">Controls the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS</string><string id="DnsOverHttpsMode_Explain">Controls the mode of the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. Please note that this policy will only set the default mode for each query. The mode may be overridden for special types of queries such as requests to resolve a DNS-over-HTTPS server hostname.

The &quot;off&quot; mode will disable DNS-over-HTTPS.

The &quot;automatic&quot; mode will send DNS-over-HTTPS queries first if a DNS-over-HTTPS server is available and may fallback to sending insecure queries on error.

The &quot;secure&quot; mode will only send DNS-over-HTTPS queries and will fail to resolve on error.

On Android Pie and above, if DNS-over-TLS is active, Google Chrome will not send insecure DNS requests.

It uses the provided directory, whether or not users specify one or turned on the flag to be prompted for download location every time.

This policy overrides the DefaultDownloadDirectory policy.

Leaving the policy unset means Chrome uses the default download directory, and users can change it.

Note: See a list of variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

Example value: /home/${user_name}/Downloads</string><string id="DownloadRestrictions">Allow download restrictions</string><string id="DownloadRestrictions_Explain">Setting the policy means users can't bypass download security decisions.

There are many types of download warnings within Chrome, which roughly break down into these categories (learn more about Safe Browsing verdicts https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=ib_download_blocked):

* Malicious, as flagged by the Safe Browsing server
* Uncommon or unwanted, as flagged by the Safe Browsing server
* A dangerous file type (e.g. all SWF downloads and many EXE downloads)

Setting the policy blocks different subsets of these, depending on it's value:

0: No special restrictions. Default.

1: Blocks malicious files flagged by the Safe Browsing server AND Blocks all dangerous file types. Only recommended for OUs/browsers/users that have a high tolerance for False Positives.

2: Blocks malicious files flagged by the Safe Browsing server AND Blocks uncommon or unwanted files flagged by the Safe Browsing server AND Blocks all dangerous file types. Only recommended for OUs/browsers/users that have a high tolerance for False Positives.

3: Blocks all downloads. Not recommended, except for special use cases.

4: Blocks malicious files flagged by the Safe Browsing server, does not block dangerous file types. Recommended.

Note: These restrictions apply to downloads triggered from webpage content, as well as the Download link... menu option. They don't apply to the download of the currently displayed page or to saving as PDF from the printing options.

This policy is defaulted to false, no emoji will be suggested and users cannot override it.</string><string id="EnableExperimentalPolicies">Enables experimental policies</string><string id="EnableExperimentalPolicies_Explain">Allows Google Chrome to load experimental policies.

WARNING: Experimental policies are unsupported and subject to change or be removed without notice in future version of the browser!

An experimental policy may not be finished or still have known or unknown defects. It may be changed or even removed without any notification. By enabling experimental policies, you could lose browser data or compromise your security or privacy.

If a policy is not in the list and it's not officially released, its value will be ignored on Beta and Stable channel.

If a policy is in the list and it's not officially released, its value will be applied.

This policy has no effect on already released policies.

Example value:

If this policy is not configured, or is set to enabled, Google Chrome will follow the default rollout process for ECH. If it is disabled, Google Chrome will not enable ECH.

When the feature is enabled, Google Chrome may or may not use ECH depending on server support, availability of the HTTPS DNS record, or rollout status.

ECH is an evolving protocol, so Google Chrome's implementation is subject to change. As such, this policy is a temporary measure to control the initial experimental implementation. It will be replaced with final controls as the protocol finalizes.</string><string id="EnterpriseHardwarePlatformAPIEnabled">Enables managed extensions to use the Enterprise Hardware Platform API</string><string id="EnterpriseHardwarePlatformAPIEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True lets extensions installed by enterprise policy use the Enterprise Hardware Platform API.

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset prevents extensions from using this API.

Note: This policy also applies to component extensions, such as the Hangout Services extension.</string><string id="EventPathEnabled">Re-enable the Event.path API until M115.</string><string id="EventPathEnabled_Explain">Starting in M109, the non-standard API Event.path will be removed to improve web compatibility. This policy re-enables the API until M115.

     If this policy is set to enabled, the Event.path API will be available.

     If this policy is set to disabled, the Event.path API will be unavailable.

     If this policy is not set, the Event.path API will be in the default status: available before M109, and unavailable in M109 to 114.

     This policy will be removed after Chrome 115.</string><string id="ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings">Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains</string><string id="ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings_Explain">You can enable this policy to create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that will be exempted from file type extension-based download warnings. This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the &quot;jnlp&quot; extension is associated with &quot;website1.com&quot;, users would not see a warning when downloading &quot;jnlp&quot; files from &quot;website1.com&quot;, but see a download warning when downloading &quot;jnlp&quot; files from &quot;website2.com&quot;.

Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Safe Browsing warnings.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.

If you enable this policy:

* The URL pattern should be formatted according to https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.
* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list &quot;jnlp&quot; should be used instead of &quot;.jnlp&quot;.

Example:

The following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.example.com domains. It will show the user a file type extension-based download warning on any other domain for exe and jnlp files, but not for swf files.

[
  { &quot;file_extension&quot;: &quot;jnlp&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;: [&quot;example.com&quot;] },
  { &quot;file_extension&quot;: &quot;exe&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;: [&quot;example.com&quot;] },
  { &quot;file_extension&quot;: &quot;swf&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;: [&quot;*&quot;] }
]

Note that while the preceding example shows the suppression of file type extension-based download warnings for &quot;swf&quot; files for all domains, applying suppression of such warnings for all domains for any dangerous file type extension is not recommended due to security concerns. It is shown in the example merely to demonstrate the ability to do so.

If this policy is enabled alongside DownloadRestrictions and DownloadRestrictions is set to block dangerous file types, download blocks determined by DownloadRestrictions take precedence. For example, if this policy is set to enable &quot;exe&quot; extension downloads from &quot;website1.com&quot;, and DownloadRestrictions is set to block malicious downloads and dangerous file types, then &quot;exe&quot; extension downloads will still be blocked in all domains. If DownloadRestrictions is not set to block dangerous file types, then file types specified in this policy will be exempted from file-type extension-based download warnings in the specified domains.

Connections to these ports will fail. This setting permits bypassing that list. The value is a comma-separated list of zero or more ports that outgoing connections will be permitted on.

Ports are restricted to prevent Google Chrome being used as a vector to exploit various network vulnerabilities. Setting this policy may expose your network to attacks. This policy is intended as a temporary workaround for errors with code &quot;ERR_UNSAFE_PORT&quot; while migrating a service running on a blocked port to a standard port (ie. port 80 or 443).

Malicious websites can easily detect that this policy is set, and for what ports, and use that information to target attacks.

Each port here is labelled with a date that it can be unblocked until. After that date the port will be restricted regardless of this setting.

Leaving the value empty or unset means that all restricted ports will be blocked. If there is a mixture of valid and invalid values, the valid ones will be applied.

Some websites make assumptions about how this header is formatted and may
encounter issues with version strings that include three digits in the

When this policy is set to -2, it will match the value of the login screen offline signin time limit which comes from GaiaOfflineSigninTimeLimitDays.

When the policy is unset, or set to a value of -1, it will not enforce online authentication on the lock screen and will allow the user to use offline authentication unless a different reason than this policy enforces an online authentication.

If the policy is set to a value of 0, online authentication will always be required.

When this policy is set to any other value, it specifies the number of days since the last online authentication after which the user must use online authentication again in the next login through the lock screen.

If this policy is unset or disabled, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site, so if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

When this policy is set to true, all Private Network Access checks are disabled for all origins. This may allow attackers to perform CSRF attacks on private network servers.

When this policy is either not set or set to false, the default behavior for requests to more-private network endpoints will depend on the user's personal configuration for the BlockInsecurePrivateNetworkRequests, PrivateNetworkAccessSendPreflights, and PrivateNetworkAccessRespectPreflightResults feature flags, which may be set by field trials or on the command line.

This policy relates to the Private Network Access specification. See https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/ for more details.

A network endpoint is more private than another if:
1) Its IP address is localhost and the other is not.
2) Its IP address is private and the other is public.
In the future, depending on spec evolution, this policy might apply to all cross-origin requests directed at private IPs or localhost.

This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality
on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a
minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when
enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.

If this policy is set to enabled then the feature will be force enabled, and

Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent
value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full

The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

If this policy is not set, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled is a related policy that may also disable DNS interception checks; this policy is a more flexible version which may separately control intranet redirection infobars and may be expanded in the future.

Each named origin's process will only be allowed to contain documents from that origin and its subdomains. For example, specifying https://a1.example.com/ allows https://a2.a1.example.com/ in the same process, but not https://example.com or https://b.example.com.

Since Google Chrome 77, you can also specify a range of origins to isolate using a wildcard. For example, specifying https://[*.]corp.example.com will give every origin underneath https://corp.example.com its own dedicated process, including https://corp.example.com itself, https://a1.corp.example.com, and https://a2.a1.corp.example.com.

Note that all sites (i.e., scheme plus eTLD+1, such as https://example.com) are already isolated by default on Desktop platforms, as noted in the SitePerProcess policy. This IsolateOrigins policy is useful to isolate specific origins at a finer granularity (e.g., https://a.example.com).

Also note that origins isolated by this policy will be unable to script other origins in the same site, which is otherwise possible if two same-site documents modify their document.domain values to match. Administrators should confirm this uncommon behavior is not used on an origin before isolating it.

Setting the policy to off or leaving it unset lets users change this setting.

Note: For Android, use the IsolateOriginsAndroid policy instead.

Normally, full screen mode is turned off when returning from the lock screen in order to reduce the risk of phishing attacks. This policy allows to specify URLs that will be considered trusted sources which are permitted to continue full screen mode on unlock. It is set by specifying a list of URL patterns formatted according to this format ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=url_blocklist_filter_format ). E.g., it is possible to always keep full screen mode on unlock and disable the notifications altogether by specifying the wildcard character * matching all URLs.

Setting this policy to an empty list or leaving it unset means no URLs are allowed to continue full screen mode without a notification.

By default, an extension or an Android applications can't use a key designated for corporate usage, which is equivalent to setting allowCorporateKeyUsage to False for it. Only if allowCorporateKeyUsage is set to True for an extension or an Android application can it use any platform key marked for corporate usage to sign arbitrary data.

This key also has a list of bookmarks, some of which can also be folders. Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted through the address bar. For example, &quot;google.com&quot; becomes &quot;https://google.com/&quot;.

Users can't change the folders the bookmarks are placed in (though they can hide it from the bookmark bar). The default folder name for managed bookmarks is &quot;Managed bookmarks&quot; but it can be changed by adding a new sub-dictionary to the policy with a single key named &quot;toplevel_name&quot; with the desired folder name as its value.

When launched, the app can create a window on top of the lock screen and create notes in this context. The app can import created notes to the primary user session, when the session is unlocked. Only Google Chrome note-taking apps are supported on the lock screen.

Setting the policy means users can turn on an app on the lock screen if the app's extension ID is in the policy list value. So, setting it to an empty list will turn off note-taking on the lock screen. The policy with an app ID doesn't necessarily mean that users can turn the app on as a note-taking app on the lock screen.

Please start using the multi-line textbox below.)</string><string id="OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled">Allows origin-keyed agent clustering by default.</string><string id="OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled_Explain">This policy allows origin-keyed agent clustering by default.

The Origin-Agent-Cluster HTTP header controls whether a document is
isolated in an origin-keyed agent cluster, or in a site-keyed agent
cluster. This has security implications since an origin-keyed agent
cluster allows isolating documents by origin. The developer-visible
consequence of this is that the document.domain accessor can no longer
be set.

The default behaviour - when no Origin-Agent-Cluster header has been set -
changes in M111 from site-keyed to origin-keyed.

If this policy is enabled or not set, the browser will follow this
new default from that version on.

If this policy is disabled this change is reversed and
documents without Origin-Agent-Cluster headers will be assigned to
site-keyed agent clusters. As a consequence, the document.domain accessor
remains settable by default. This matches the legacy behaviour.

See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain/ for
additional details.</string><string id="OsColorMode">ChromeOS color mode</string><string id="OsColorMode_Explain">Controls the theme used to render UI during OOBE and in session (dark/light/auto).

insecure origins should not apply</string><string id="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as *.example.com) for which security restrictions on insecure origins won't apply. Organizations can specify origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development, so developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled &quot;Not Secure&quot; in the address bar.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy amounts to setting the command-line flag --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. The policy overrides the command-line flag and UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

For more information on secure contexts, see Secure Contexts ( https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts ).

This policy setting enables notifications to inform the user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required. If not set, Google Chrome indicates to the user that a relaunch is needed via subtle changes to its menu, while Google Chrome OS indicates such via a notification in the system tray. If set to 'Recommended', a recurring warning will be shown to the user that a relaunch is recommended. The user can dismiss this warning to defer the relaunch. If set to 'Required', a recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The default period is seven days for Google Chrome and four days for Google Chrome OS, and may be configured via the RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy setting.

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Google Chrome OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Google Chrome browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

Users are notified of the need for a browser relaunch or device restart based on the RelaunchNotification and RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy settings. Browsers and devices are forcibly restarted at the end of the notification period when the RelaunchNotification policy is set to 'Required'. This RelaunchWindow policy can be used to defer the end of the notification period so that it falls within a specific time window.

If this policy is not set, the default target time window for Google Chrome OS is between 2 AM and 4 AM. The default target time window for Google Chrome is the whole day (i.e., the end of the notification period is never deferred).

Note: Though the policy can accept multiple items in entries, all but the first item are ignored.

If the policy is set to a value of 0, online authentication will always be required.

When this policy is set to any other value, it specifies the number of days since the last online authentication after which the user must use online authentication again in the next login through the lock screen.

If this policy is unset or set to true, the default behavior will be used: signing in to a different Google Account from the browser content area and Android applications will be allowed, except for child accounts where it will be blocked for non-Incognito content area.

In case signing in to a different account shouldn't be allowed via the Incognito mode, consider blocking that mode using the IncognitoModeAvailability policy.

The action will only happen after this notification expires. The user can prevent the action from happening by re-inserting the smart card before the notification expires. If this policy is set to zero, no notification will be displayed and the action happens immediately.</string><string id="SendMouseEventsDisabledFormControlsEnabled">Control the new behavior for event dispatching on disabled form controls</string><string id="SendMouseEventsDisabledFormControlsEnabled_Explain">Event dispatching on disabled form controls is being changed in chromium in order to improve compatibility with other browsers and to improve developer experience.

This change makes MouseEvents get dispatched on disabled form control elements except click, mouseup, and mousedown. The new events will include mousemove, mouseenter, and mouseleave for example.

This change also truncates the event path of click, mouseup, and mousedown when they are dispatched on children of disabled form controls so they are not dispatched on the disabled form control or any of its ancestors.

The new behavior may break some websites.

If this policy is enabled, then the new behavior will be used.

If this policy is disabled, then the old behavior will be used.

If this policy is not set, then the new behavior will be used just like the rest of chromium users.</string><string id="SessionLengthLimit">Limit the length of a user session</string><string id="SessionLengthLimit_Explain">When this policy is set, it specifies the length of time after which a user is automatically logged out, terminating the session. The user is informed about the remaining time by a countdown timer shown in the system tray.

When this policy is not set, the session length is not limited.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to a range of 30 seconds to 24 hours.</string><string id="SessionLocales">Set the recommended locales for a managed session</string><string id="SessionLocales_Explain">Setting the policy (as recommended only) moves recommended locales for a managed session to the top of the list, in the order in which they appear in the policy. The first recommended locale is preselected.

If not set, the current UI locale is preselected.

For more than one recommended locale, the assumption is that users want to choose among these locales. Locale and keyboard layout selection is prominent when starting a managed session. Otherwise, the assumption is that most users want the preselected locale. Locale and keyboard layout selection is less prominent when starting a managed session.

If you set the policy and turn automatic sign-in on (see the DeviceLocalAccountAutoLoginId and DeviceLocalAccountAutoLoginDelay policies), the managed session uses the first recommended locale and the most popular matching keyboard layout.

The preselected keyboard layout is always the most popular layout matching the preselected locale. Users can always choose any locale supported by Google Chrome OS for their session.

A site is a scheme plus eTLD+1 (e.g., https://example.com). Setting this policy to Enabled does not change that behavior; it only prevents users from opting out (for example, using Disable site isolation in chrome://flags). Since Google Chrome 76, setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset doesn't turn off site isolation, but instead allows users to opt out.

IsolateOrigins might also be useful for isolating specific origins at a finer granularity than site (e.g., https://a.example.com).

On Google Chrome OS version 76 and earlier, set the DeviceLoginScreenSitePerProcess device policy to the same value. (If the values don't match, a delay can occur when entering a user session.)

When enabled or unset, then worker scripts will use strict MIME type checking for JavaScript, which is the new default behaviour. Worker scripts with legacy MIME types will be rejected.

When disabled, then worker scripts will use lax MIME type checking, so that worker scripts with legacy MIME types, e.g. text/ascii, will continue to be loaded and executed.

Browsers traditionally used lax MIME type checking, so that resources with a number of legacy MIME types were supported. E.g. for JavaScript resources, text/ascii is a legacy supported MIME type. This may cause security issues, by allowing to load resources as scripts that were never intended to be used as such. Chrome will transition to use strict MIME type checking in the near future. The enabled policy will track the default behaviour. Disabling this policy allows administrators to retain the legacy behaviour, if desired.

See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#scriptingLanguage for details about JavaScript / ECMAScript media types.

From Google Chrome version 73, you can block javascript://* URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript entered in the address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). In-page JavaScript URLs with dynamically loaded data aren't subject to this policy. For example, if you block example.com/abc, then example.com can still load example.com/abc using XMLHTTPRequest.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member:
url (the URL of the web app to install)

and 6 optional members:
- default_launch_container
(for how the web app opens—a new tab is the default)

- create_desktop_shortcut
(True if you want to create Linux and
Microsoft® Windows® desktop shortcuts).

- fallback_app_name
(Starting with Google Chrome version 90,
allows you to override the app name if it is not a
Progressive Web App (PWA), or the app name that is temporarily
installed if it is a PWA but authentication is required before the
installation can be completed. If both
custom_name and
fallback_app_name are provided,
the latter will be ignored.)

- custom_name
(Starting with Google Chrome OS
version 99, and version 111 on all other operating systems, allows you to
permanently override the app name for all web apps and PWAs.)

- custom_icon
(Starting with Google Chrome OS
version 99, and version 111 on all other operating systems, allows you to
override the app icon of installed apps. The icons have to be square,
maximal 1 MB in size, and in one of the following formats: jpeg, png, gif, webp, ico.
The hash value has to be the SHA256 hash of the icon file.)

- install_as_shortcut
(Starting with Google Chrome
version 107). If enabled the given url
will be installed as a shortcut, as if done via the &quot;Create Shortcut...&quot;
option in the desktop browser GUI.
Note that when installed as a shortcut it won't be updated if the
manifest in url changes.
If disabled or unset, the web app at the given
url will be installed normally.

These logs have no audio or video content from the meeting. To make debugging easier, Google might associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself.

Setting the policy to Disabled results in no collection or uploading of such logs.

Leaving the policy unset on versions up to and including M76 means Google Chrome defaults to not being able to collect and upload these logs. Starting at M77, Google Chrome defaults to being able to collect and upload these logs from most profiles affected by cloud-based, user-level enterprise policies.

Usage restrictions can be applied to the apps installed on Google Chrome OS for the given user.
Restrictions should be passed in |app_limits| list. Only one entry per-app is allowed. Apps not included in the list have no restrictions.
It is not possible to block apps that are essential for the operating system, the restrictions for such apps will be ignored.
App is uniquely identified by |app_id|. Since different types of apps can use different id format |app_type| needs to be specified next to |app_id|.
Per-App Time Limits only support |ARC| apps currently. Android package name is used as |app_id|.
Support for other types of applications will be added in the future, for now they can be specified in the policy, but the restrictions will take no effect.
There are two types of available restrictions: |BLOCK| and |TIME_LIMIT|.
|BLOCK| makes app unavailable for the user. If |daily_limit_mins| is specified with |BLOCK| restriction |daily_limit_mins| will be ignored.
|TIME_LIMITS| applies daily usage limit and makes app unavailable after the limit is reached on the given day. Usage limit is specified in |daily_limit_mins|. Usage limit is reset daily at the UTC time passed in |reset_at|.
This policy is only used for child users.
This policy is complementary to 'UsageTimeLimit'. Restrictions specified in 'UsageTimeLimit' like screen time and bedtime will be enforced regardless of 'PerAppTimeLimits'.

The |time_window_limit| specifies a daily window in which the user's session should be locked. We only support one rule for each day of the week, therefore the |entries| array may vary from 0-7 in size. |starts_at| and |ends_at| are the beginning and the end of the window limit, when |ends_at| is smaller than |starts_at| it means that the |time_limit_window| ends on the following day. |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should be set only if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be use in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

|overrides| is provided to invalidate temporarily one or more of the previous rules.
* If neither time_window_limit nor time_usage_limit is active |LOCK| can be used to lock the device.
* |LOCK| temporarily locks a user session until the next time_window_limit or time_usage_limit starts.
* |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.
|created_time_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the override creation, it is sent as a String because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer It is used to determine whether this override should still be applied. If the current active time limit feature (time usage limit or time window limit) started after the override was created, it should not take action. Also if the override was created before the last change of the active time_window_limit or time_usage_window it should not be applied.

Multiple overrides may be sent, the newest valid entry is the one that is going to be applied.

Instead of showing the same textfield that is used for password input, this
feature shows a special UI that clearly shows to the user how many
digits are necessary for their PIN. As a consequence, the user's PIN length
will be stored outside the user encrypted data. Only supports PINs that are
between 6 and 12 digits long.

If the policy is set to true, users will have PIN auto-submit on the lock and login screen.
If the policy is set to false or not set, users will not have PIN auto-submit on the lock and login screen.

If this policy is set, users will not have the option of enabling the feature.</string><string id="PinUnlockMaximumLength">Set the maximum length of the lock screen PIN</string><string id="PinUnlockMaximumLength_Explain">Setting the policy means the configured maximum PIN length is enforced. A value of 0 or less means the user may set a PIN of any length. If the value is less than PinUnlockMinimumLength but greater than 0, the maximum length is set to the minimum length.

Leaving the policy unset means no maximum length is enforced.</string><string id="PinUnlockMinimumLength">Set the minimum length of the lock screen PIN</string><string id="PinUnlockMinimumLength_Explain">Setting the policy enforces the minimum PIN length chosen. (Values below 1 are rounded up to the minimum of 1.)

Leaving the policy unset enforces a minimal PIN length of 6 digits, the recommended minimum.</string><string id="PinUnlockWeakPinsAllowed">Enable users to set weak PINs for the lock screen PIN</string><string id="PinUnlockWeakPinsAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled allows weak PINs. Some characteristics of weak PINs: only one digit (1111), digits increase by 1 (1234), digits decrease by 1 (4321), and common PINs. Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't set weak, easy-to-guess PINs.

If policy is not set, users get a warning, not an error, for a weak PIN.</string><string id="QuickUnlockModeAllowlist">Configure allowed quick unlock modes</string><string id="QuickUnlockModeAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy controls which quick unlock modes can unlock the lock screen.

To allow:

* Every quick unlock mode, use [&quot;all&quot;] (includes modes added in the future).

* Only PIN unlock, use [&quot;PIN&quot;].

* PIN and fingerprint, use [&quot;PIN&quot;, &quot;FINGERPRINT&quot;].

If the policy is unset or set to an empty list, no quick unlock modes are available for managed devices.

Example value:

PIN</string><string id="QuickUnlockModeAllowlistDesc">Configure allowed quick unlock modes</string><string id="QuickUnlockTimeout">Set how often user has to enter password to use quick unlock</string><string id="QuickUnlockTimeout_Explain">Setting the policy controls how often the lock screen requests the password for quick unlock. Each time the lock screen appears, if the last password entry occurred before the time window specified by the value chosen, quick unlock won't be available. If users stay on the lock screen past this amount of time, a password is requested next time they enter the wrong code or re-enter the lock screen, whichever comes first.

Leaving the policy unset means users using quick unlock enter their password on the lock screen daily.</string><string id="QuickUnlockTimeout_SixHours">Password entry is required every six hours</string><string id="QuickUnlockTimeout_TweleveHours">Password entry is required every twelve hours</string><string id="QuickUnlockTimeout_TwoDays">Password entry is required every two days (48 hours)</string><string id="QuickUnlockTimeout_Week">Password entry is required every week (168 hours)</string><string id="RemoteAccess_group">Remote access</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRelayedConnection">Enable the use of relay servers by the remote access host</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRelayedConnection_Explain">If RemoteAccessHostFirewallTraversal is set to Enabled, setting RemoteAccessHostAllowRelayedConnection to Enabled or leaving it unset allows the use of remote clients to use relay servers to connect to this machine when a direct connection is not available, for example, because of firewall restrictions.

Setting the policy to Disabled doesn't turn remote access off, but only allows connections from the same network (not NAT traversal or relay).</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRemoteSupportConnections">Allow remote support connections to this machine</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRemoteSupportConnections_Explain">If this policy is disabled, the remote support host cannot be started or configured to accept incoming connections.

This policy does not affect remote access scenarios.

This policy does not prevent enterprise admins from connecting to managed Google Chrome OS devices.

This policy has no effect if enabled, left empty, or is not set.</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList">Configure the required domain names for remote access clients</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the client domain names that are imposed on remote access clients, and users can't change them. Only clients from one of the specified domains can connect to the host.

Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset applies the default policy for the connection type. For remote assistance, this allows clients from any domain to connect to the host. For anytime remote access, only the host owner can connect.

See also RemoteAccessHostDomainList.

Note: This setting overrides RemoteAccessHostClientDomain, if present.

If a value of 0 is set, then clipboard sync is disabled.

This policy affects both remote access and remote support scenarios.

This policy has no effect if it is not set.

Setting the policy to a value that is not within the min/max range may prevent the host from starting.

Please note that the actual upper bound for the clipboard size is based on the maximum WebRTC data channel message size which this policy does not control.</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostDomainList">Configure the required domain names for remote access hosts</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostDomainList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the host domain names that are imposed on remote access hosts, and users can't change them. Hosts can be shared only using accounts registered on one of the specified domain names.

Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset means hosts can be shared using any account.

Leaving the policy unset or set to an empty string means the remote access host can use any available port.

Note: If RemoteAccessHostFirewallTraversal is Disabled, the remote access host will use UDP ports in the 12400-12409 range.

Example value: 12400-12409</string><string id="Attestation_group">Remote attestation</string><string id="AttestationEnabledForUser">Enable remote attestation for the user</string><string id="AttestationEnabledForUser_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled lets users use the hardware on Google Chrome OS devices to remotely attest its identity to the privacy CA through the Enterprise Platform Keys API using chrome.enterprise.platformKeys.challengeUserKey().

Extensions must be on this list to use the API.

If an extension is not in the list, or the list is not set, the call to the API fails with an error code.

Example value:

Specifically, if a URL matches one of the patterns provided through this policy, it will be allowed to receive a HTTP header containing a response to a remote attestation challenge, attesting device identity and device state.

If this policy is not set or is set to an empty list, no URL is allowed to use remote attestation on the sign-in screen.

For Google Chrome to correctly capture the salted hash of the new password on this change password page, make sure your change password page follows these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

Turning the policy off or leaving it unset means the service sends users to https://myaccount.google.com to change their password.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

For Google Chrome to correctly capture password salted hashes, ensure your sign-in pages follow these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

Turning this setting off or leaving it unset means the password protection service only captures the password salted hashes on https://accounts.google.com.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

Use PasswordProtectionLoginURLs and PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL to set which password to protect.

If this policy is set to:

* PasswordProtectionWarningOff, no password protection warning will be shown.

* PasswordProtectionWarningOnPasswordReuse, password protection warning will be shown when the user reuses their protected password on a non-allowed site.

* PasswordProtectionWarningOnPhishingReuse, password protection warning will be shown when the user reuses their protected password on a phishing site.

Leaving the policy unset has the password protection service only protect Google passwords, but users can change this setting.</string><string id="PasswordProtectionWarningTrigger_PasswordProtectionWarningOff">Password protection warning is off</string><string id="PasswordProtectionWarningTrigger_PasswordProtectionWarningOnPasswordReuse">Password protection warning is triggered by password reuse</string><string id="PasswordProtectionWarningTrigger_PasswordProtectionWarningOnPhishingReuse">Password protection warning is triggered by password reuse on phishing page</string><string id="SafeBrowsingAllowlistDomains">Configure the list of domains on which Safe Browsing will not trigger warnings.</string><string id="SafeBrowsingAllowlistDomains_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means Safe Browsing will trust the domains you designate. It won't check them for dangerous resources such as phishing, malware, or unwanted software. Safe Browsing's download protection service won't check downloads hosted on these domains. Its password protection service won't check for password reuse.

Leaving the policy unset means default Safe Browsing protection applies to all resources.

This policy must be set as a list of fully qualified domain names. It does not support regular expressions, and will not allowlist subdomains of domains listed in the policy.

Setting the policy to Disabled means reports are never sent.

If you set this policy, users can't change it. If not set, users can decide whether to send reports or not.

If this policy is set to 'NoProtection' (value 0), Safe Browsing is never active.

If this policy is set to 'StandardProtection' (value 1, which is the default), Safe Browsing is always active in the standard mode.

If this policy is set to 'EnhancedProtection' (value 2), Safe Browsing is always active in the enhanced mode, which provides better security, but requires sharing more browsing information with Google.

If you set this policy as mandatory, users cannot change or override the Safe Browsing setting in Google Chrome.

If this policy is left not set, Safe Browsing will operate in Standard Protection mode but users can change this setting.

Enables a page at chrome://password-change that lets SAML users change their SAML passwords while in-session, which ensures that the SAML password and the device lockscreen password are kept in-sync.

This policy also enables notifications that warn SAML users if their SAML passwords are soon to expire so that they can deal with this immediately by doing an in-session password change.
But, these notifications will only be shown if password expiry information is sent to the device by the SAML identity provider during the SAML login flow.

Setting this policy to Disabled or not set, SAML password can't be changed at chrome://password-change and there won't be any notification when SAML passwords are soon to expire.</string><string id="SAMLOfflineSigninTimeLimit">Limit the time for which a user authenticated via SAML can log in offline</string><string id="SAMLOfflineSigninTimeLimit_Explain">During login, Google Chrome OS can authenticate against a server (online) or using a cached password (offline).

When this policy is set to a value of -1, the user can authenticate offline indefinitely. When this policy is set to any other value, it specifies the length of time since the last online authentication after which the user must use online authentication again.

Leaving this policy not set will make Google Chrome OS use a default time limit of 14 days after which the user must use online authentication again.

This policy affects only users who authenticated using SAML.

The policy value should be specified in seconds.</string><string id="SamlPasswordExpirationAdvanceWarningDays">How many days in advance to notify SAML users when their password is due to expire</string><string id="SamlPasswordExpirationAdvanceWarningDays_Explain">This policy has no effect unless SamlInSessionPasswordChangeEnabled is true.
If that policy is true, and this policy is set to (for example) 14, that means SAML users will be notified 14 days in advance that their password is due to expire on a certain date.
Then they can deal with this immediately by doing an in-session password change and updating their password before it expires.
But, these notifications will only be shown if password expiry information is sent to the device by the SAML identity provider during the SAML login flow.
Setting this policy to zero means the users will not be notified in advance - they will only be notified once the password has already expired.

If this policy is set, the user cannot change or override it.</string><string id="Projector_group">Screencast</string><string id="ProjectorDogfoodForFamilyLinkEnabled">Enable Screencast dogfood for Family Link users</string><string id="ProjectorDogfoodForFamilyLinkEnabled_Explain">This policy enables Screencast feature for Family Link users and gives it permission to create and transcribe screen recording and upload to Drive.

This policy is only useful in combination with DeviceUserAllowlist. It allows Family Link accounts additionally to the accounts defined in the allowlist.
This policy does not affect the behavior of other sign-in policies. Particularly it will not have any effect when:
- Adding new users to the device is disabled with DeviceAllowNewUsers policy.
- Adding all users is allowed with DeviceUserAllowlist policy.

If this policy is set to false (or not configured), no additional rules will be applied to Family Link accounts.

Guest logins are anonymous user sessions and do not require a password.

If this policy is set to false, Google Chrome OS will not allow guest sessions to be started.</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenAutoSelectCertificateForUrls">Automatically select client certificates for these sites on the sign-in screen</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenAutoSelectCertificateForUrls_Explain">Allows you to specify a list of url patterns that specify sites for which a client certificate is automatically selected on the sign-in screen in the frame hosting the SAML flow, if the site requests a certificate. An example usage is to configure a device-wide certificate to be presented to the SAML IdP.

The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;$URL_PATTERN&quot;, &quot;filter&quot; : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the &quot;ISSUER&quot; and the &quot;SUBJECT&quot; sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with the &quot;O&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with a &quot;OU&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.



If this policy is left not set, no auto-selection will be done for any site.

If this policy is set to a string representing a domain name, Google Chrome OS will show an autocomplete option during user sign-in allowing the user to type in only their user name without the domain name extension.  The user will be able to overwrite this domain name extension.
If the value of the policy is not a valid domain, the policy will not be applied.

Example value: students.school.edu</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenExtensions">Configure the list of installed apps and extensions on the login screen</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenExtensions_Explain">
Specifies a list of apps and extensions that are installed silently on the login screen, without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled or disabled by the user.

Permissions requested by the apps/extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction, including any additional permissions requested by future versions of the app/extension. Google Chrome restricts the set of permissions that the extensions can request.

Note that, for security and privacy reasons, only apps and extensions that belong to the allow list bundled into Google Chrome can be installed. All other items will be ignored.

If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by Google Chrome.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on chrome://extensions when in developer mode. The &quot;update&quot; URL, if specified, should point to an update manifest XML document as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is &quot;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx&quot;). Note that the &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest.

For example, khpfeaanjngmcnplbdlpegiifgpfgdco;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx installs the Smart Card Connector app from the standard Chrome Web Store &quot;update&quot; URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.

If this policy is set to a list of input method identifiers, the given input methods will be available on the sign-in screen. The first given input method will be preselected. While a user pod is focused on the sign-in screen, the user's last used input method will be available in addition to the input methods given by this policy. If this policy is not set, the input methods on the sign-in screen will be derived from the locale in which the sign-in screen is displayed. Values which are not valid input method identifiers will be ignored.

If this policy is set, the sign-in screen will always be displayed in the locale which is given by the first value of this policy (the policy is defined as a list for forward compatibility).  If this policy is not set or is set to an empty list, the sign-in screen will be displayed in the locale of the last user session.  If this policy is set to a value which is not a valid locale, the sign-in screen will be displayed in a fallback locale (currently, en-US).

en-US</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenLocalesDesc">Device sign-in screen locale</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenPromptOnMultipleMatchingCertificates">Prompt when multiple certificates match on the sign-in screen</string><string id="DeviceLoginScreenPromptOnMultipleMatchingCertificates_Explain">This policy controls whether the user is prompted to select a client certificate on the sign-in screen in the frame hosting the SAML flow when more than one certificate matches DeviceLoginScreenAutoSelectCertificateForUrls.
If this policy is set to Enabled, the user is asked to select the client certificate whenever the auto-selection policy matches multiple certificates.
If this policy is set to Disabled or not set, the user is never prompted to select a client certificate on the sign-in screen.
Note: This policy is in general not recommended, since it imposes potential privacy risks (in case device-wide TPM-backed certificates are used) and presents poor user experience.</string><string id="DeviceRunAutomaticCleanupOnLogin">Control automatic cleanup during login</string><string id="DeviceRunAutomaticCleanupOnLogin_Explain">When this policy is set to true, automatic cleanup is executed during login to ensure enough free disk space is available.

If this policy is set to false, Google Chrome OS will not show existing users on the login screen. The normal sign-in screen (prompting for the user email and password or phone) or the SAML interstitial screen (if enabled via the LoginAuthenticationBehavior policy) will be shown, unless a Managed Session is configured. When a Managed Session is configured, only the Managed Session accounts will be shown, allowing to pick one of them.

Note that this policy does not affect whether the device keeps or discards the local user data.</string><string id="DeviceUserAllowlist">Login user allow list</string><string id="DeviceUserAllowlist_Explain">Defines the list of users that are allowed to login to the device. Entries are of the form user@domain, such as madmax@managedchrome.com. To allow arbitrary users on a domain, use entries of the form *@domain.

If this policy is not configured, there are no restrictions on which users are allowed to sign in. Note that creating new users still requires the DeviceAllowNewUsers policy to be configured appropriately.
If DeviceFamilyLinkAccountsAllowed is enabled, Family Link users will be allowed additionally to the accounts defined in this policy.

Example value:

The policy is set by specifying the URL from which the ChromeOS device can download the wallpaper image and a cryptographic hash used to verify the integrity of the download. The image must be in JPEG format, its file size must not exceed 16MB. The URL must be accessible without any authentication. The wallpaper image is downloaded and cached. It will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

If the device wallpaper policy is set, the ChromeOS device will download and use the wallpaper image on the login screen if no user has yet signed in to the device. Once the user logs in, the user's wallpaper policy kicks in.

If the device wallpaper policy is left not set, it's the user's wallpaper policy to decide what to show if the user's wallpaper policy is set.

Setting the policy to Disabled means that their homepage is never the New Tab page, unless the user's homepage URL is set to chrome://newtab.

If you set the policy, users can't change their homepage type in Google Chrome. If not set, the user decides whether or not the New Tab page is their homepage.

The New Tab page opens with new tabs and windows.

This policy doesn't decide which pages open on start up. Those are controlled by the RestoreOnStartup policies. This policy does affect the homepage, if that's set to open the New Tab page, as well as the startup page if it's set to open the New Tab page.

It is a best practice to provide fully canonicalized URL, if the URL is not fully canonicalized Google Chrome will default to https://.

Leaving the policy unset or empty puts the default New Tab page in use.
